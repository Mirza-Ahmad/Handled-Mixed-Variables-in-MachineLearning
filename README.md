# Handled-Mixed-Variables-in-MachineLearning
### When working with machine learning algorithms, it is important to handle mixed variables appropriately to ensure effective model training and prediction. Here are a few common approaches for handling mixed variables in machine learning.
### There are different ways to handle mixed varaibles.
### (i) If the data in the form like CB123, A9183 then we will make two new columns the first is categorical and other is numerical. The categorical contained categorical information and numerical column contained numerical information. 
### (ii) If the value in the form like 1,7,3,A,C,5 then numerical value put into the numerical column and put NA in the corresponding categorical column.
### (iii) If your mixed variables have missing values, you need to decide on a strategy to handle them. Some common approaches include removing rows with missing values, filling in missing values with a statistical measure (e.g., mean or median), or using more advanced techniques like imputation models.
### (iv) Feature engineering involves creating new features derived from the existing mixed variables to capture additional information. For example, you can create interaction terms between variables, derive statistical measures (e.g., mean, standard deviation) from numerical variables, or extract meaningful information from text or date variables.
